        <h1>CSS Dump</h1>
        <p>A collection of a bunch of random CSS and SCSS (Sass) works I've created that are neat enough to show off.</p>
        <h2>Live Demos</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <a href="things/dna/dna.html">DNA Helix</a> - Done in the style of primary school textbooks where Red-Green are Adenine-Thymine pairs and Yellow-Blue are Cytosine-Guanine pairs, complete with bonding shapes.
            </li>
            <li>
                <a href="things/flag/flag.html">Waving Flag</a> - Made by request. It consists of 800 individual waving pixels, overlapped on top of one another, moving in sync due to animation delays.
